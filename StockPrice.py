# This program uses an artificial recurrent nueral network called Long Short Term Memory or (LSTM) for short.
# We are going to use the LSTM to predict the closing price of a particular company's stock, using the past 60 day stock price.

# Here we are importing the required libraries.
# Also had to install TensorFlow in terminal.
